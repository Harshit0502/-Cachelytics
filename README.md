# Cachelytics
 Cachelytics simulates cache memory behavior with policies like LRU, FIFO, and LFU to analyze hits, misses, and evictions. Integrated with ML models, it predicts cache performance trends. A Flask-powered web interface visualizes metrics, making it ideal for memory optimization and understanding cache efficiency under diverse workloads
